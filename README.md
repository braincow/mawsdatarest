# mawsdatarest

An exercise on creating a RESTful API for weather data serving.

## Design goals
* OpenShift Online, local or whatever execution environment.
* Simple, extensible and re-usable framework
* Python3
* Microservice approach with RESTful API
* MongoDB (I wanted to try out CouchBase, but they do not have OpenShift cartridge available)

This app is designed to be run at Red Hat OpenShift Online, but it can also be run locally or even outside of OpenShift with slight modifications. See config/README.md for more information.
