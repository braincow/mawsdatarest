# mawsdatarest

An exercise on creating a RESTful API for weather data manipulation among other things.

## Design goals
* OpenShift Online
* Simple framework
* Python3
* Microservice approach with RESTful API
* MongoDB (I wanted to try out CouchBase, but they do not have OpenShift cartridge.

This app is designed to be run at Red Hat OpenShift Online, but it can also be run locally or even outside of OpenShift with slight modifications. See config/README.md for more information.
